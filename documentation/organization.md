# Where, what, how?

This document describes what conventions are being used in this project, what tools are recommended and where to put which content, artifact or question.

## General discussion

General questions about this project can be placed in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/fVDpb9wsHy) at any time. Due to the origin of this project we accept questions and answers in English and German.

## Issues

If you feel something could be improved (bugs or feature requests) you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gam3du/gam3du/issues). Issues are expected to be written in English - feel free to use an online translation service if needed.

## Documentation

### Architecture

Description of the project's structure and technical documentation shall be placed in this repository under `docs` (next to this document) in order to keep them in sync with the actual implementation.

### Code

Code shall be as self-descriptive as possible. In order to achieve that, avoid using abbreviations in identifiers. There's no need to document private functions and elements with obvious purpose (getters, setters, `new`, ...). Public elements however shall have at least a single line of documentation and a description of failure modes - _clippy_ will help you to remember that :)

### User

Documentation on how to use the project shall go to our [Wiki](https://github.com/gam3du/gam3du/wiki). It has yet to be decided where graphics shall be stored so that they can be changed later.

## Code conventions and style

- All identifiers and comments shall be written in American English.
- The use of clippy is mandatory
- The use of rustfmt is mandatory
- avoid using abbreviations in identifiers
- Handling all compile errors before pushing to a public branch is mandatory - it shall always be possible to build those branches.
- Handling all warnings in a timely manner is highly recommended. It is ok to suppress specific warnings with an explanatation and maybe a `TODO` marker
- If you suppress any linter message, add a short description about _why_ this was necessary.
- Make use of `todo!` and `unimplemented!` or add `// TODO [your github name] your message` comments if you know your implementation still has holes but it helps you to make progress.
- Use `// FIXME [your github name] <your message>` if you spot/create any error you cannot or don't want to fix (yet).

Avoid _super smart_ solutions if they impair readability. _Gam3du_ is an educational project and shall be accessible to newbies. Sometimes complexity cannot be avoided. Try to encapsulate those parts as good as possible and add an explanation why this particular solution has been chosen and how it works (maybe add a link to external resources explaining the algorithm).
